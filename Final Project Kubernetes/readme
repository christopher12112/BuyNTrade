While accesing front end, we were getting CORS error"No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource."
In order to fix that issue we had to run minikube with extra config. as shown below  
	$ minikube start --extra-config apiserver.cors-allowed-origins=["http://*"]
	$ & minikube -p minikube docker-env | Invoke-Expression
	$ minikube docker-env | Invoke-Expression
	$ docker build -t front-end:v1 ./front-end 
	$ docker build -t back-end:v1 .

To create, user and token table in database, We have configured configmap. In order to run it we need to run below command.  
	$ kubectl create configmap initdb-config --from-file initdb.sql 
	$ kubectl apply -f .

We were not able to connect to backend from frontend since it was having proxy error and were getting 500 error code. 
due to this reason we had to start a proxy server using below coomand.
	$ kubectl.exe proxy --port=8080 (in a seprate powershell this command needs to executed and keep it open )
	
	$ minikube service front-end  
	
	
To check provided username/password is there in database, login to any mysql pod and

$ mysql -u root
$use buytradedb;
$select * from user;
